- Init type converters for non-linked properties.
	e.g. Index field may not be binded in ImageWidget while File field may be.
	To fix, load a default type converter which does nothing. Possible fix is to use 
	base class 'CF_TypeConverter' as a global variable and by default be assigned
	to all views type converters. These do nothing.
